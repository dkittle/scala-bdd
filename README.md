# Introduction

I'm working on a project structure which executes selenium tests against a web application.  My goal is to practice BDD (Behaviour Drive Development) with my team so devs have a bit more responsibility for the user stories they are  implementing - specifically that they at least cover off a happy path test of the stories they implement that have some sort of user interface.
